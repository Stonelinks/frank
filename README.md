#frank

Personal, omniscient life assistant. Also a pretty cool guy.

I'm making frank because I suck at keeping track of my shit. Realistically, I know I'm too lazy to actually put the effort into changing this about myself, so instead I thought it would be much more useful (and more fun) to engineer a tool that keeps track of stuff for me.

So what kind of things will frank keep track of? Nothing the NSA doesn't already know (heyyyoooo!) but for real right now it keeps track of jack squat.

###Setup

These are quick notes:

sudo npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower mocha-phantomjs 

sudo rm -r ~/.npm ~/tmp

npm install
